In order to help me branch out musically here in Norway, I wanted to find Norwegian producers that I liked.  Instead of going one by one through the 650+ people I follow on SoundCloud, I decided to playaround with Ruby and SoundCloud's API to find the people I was looking for. I also wanted to do so without using the soundcloud gem, only the HTTP API.  Now I can search all of the followings of a particular user for Scandinavian ties.
