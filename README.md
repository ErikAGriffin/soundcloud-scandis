In order to help me branch out musically here in Norway, I wanted to find Norwegian producers that I liked.  Instead of going one by one through the 650+ people I follow on SoundCloud, I decided to play around with Ruby and SoundCloud's API to find the people I was looking for. I also wanted to do so completely independent of the soundcloud gem, and use only the HTTP API.  Now I can search all of the followings of a particular user for Scandinavian ties with a few simple commands in IRB.
